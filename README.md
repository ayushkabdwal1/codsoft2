Sure! Let's dive into the theory of building a portfolio website using HTML and CSS:

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):
HTML is the standard markup language used to create the structure and content of a web page. It consists of a series of elements, each represented by a tag, which define the different parts of a webpage. Here are some essential HTML elements you'll use in a portfolio website:

<html>: The root element of an HTML document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the webpage, such as character encoding and viewport settings.
<title>: Sets the title of the webpage, which appears in the browser's title bar or tab.
<body>: Contains the visible content of the webpage, including headings, paragraphs, images, and other elements.
<h1>, <h2>, <h3>: Headings that create a hierarchical structure for your content.
<p>: Represents a paragraph of text.
<a>: Defines a hyperlink, allowing you to link to other web pages or external resources.
<img>: Embeds an image on the webpage.
<ul>, <ol>, <li>: Create unordered and ordered lists with list items, respectively.
<div>: A generic container that helps with structuring and styling your content.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
CSS is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation and layout of HTML documents. It allows you to control the colors, fonts, spacing, and other visual aspects of your portfolio website. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. Here are some important CSS concepts:

Selectors: CSS selectors target HTML elements based on their tag names, classes, IDs, or attributes.
Properties: CSS properties define the visual aspects of elements, such as color, font-size, margin, padding, etc.
Classes and IDs: Classes and IDs allow you to target specific elements and apply unique or shared styles to them.
Box Model: The box model describes how elements are structured with content, padding, borders, and margins.
Layout: CSS provides several layout techniques, like Flexbox and Grid, to control the positioning and alignment of elements on the page.
Responsive Design: CSS can be used to create responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.
Structure of a Portfolio Website:
A typical portfolio website often follows a common structure:

Header: Contains the logo, navigation menu, and possibly a hero image or introduction.
About Me: A section where you introduce yourself, your background, skills, and interests.
Projects: Showcase your work, projects, or case studies with brief descriptions and images or links to more details.
Contact: Provide contact information or a contact form for visitors to reach out to you.
Footer: Includes copyright information and possibly links to your social media profiles.
Responsive Design:
In modern web development, it's crucial to create responsive websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. Use CSS media queries and fluid layout techniques to ensure your portfolio looks good on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
